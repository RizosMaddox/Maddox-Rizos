    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p><em>HTML</em> is great. It defines the structure of webpages and it determines how data is displayed online. <br>
    What you're looking at right now is HTML code, read and interpreted by your browser. But this doesn't make HTML a <del>programming language</del>.</p>

    <h3>A Markup Language</h3>
    <p><strong>HTML</strong> is a type of markup language. It encapsulates, or "marks up" data within HTML tags. The <br>
    HTML describes the data to the browser, and the browser then displays the data accordingly.</p>

    <hr>

    <p><strong>For example:</strong><br>
    If we want to write the chemical equation H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> = H<sub>2</sub>O <br><br>
    or Mathematical equation X<sup>2</sup> + Y<sup>2</sup> = Z<sup>2</sup> <br><br>
    or Special characters &amp; Â© <br><br>
    you should use the suitable tag for each one :)</p>
